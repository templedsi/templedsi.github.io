The **Data Science Institute (DSI)** at Temple University was established to advance data science as a discipline and to foster collaboration between academia, industry, and government.

The DSI is co-directed by [Edoardo Airoldi](https://airoldi.github.io/), the Millard E. Gladfelter Professor of Statistics and Data Science in the Fox School of Business, and serves as a university-wide resource for data science research and education.
