## Mission

The Data Science Institute (DSI) is the home to cutting-edge research in data science and analytics education at Temple University. Focusing on a wide range of challenging methodological and applied problems in statistics, computer science, and business disciplines, the faculty in the Data Science Institute works closely with private corporations, non-profits, and government organizations to identify important problems, and to collaboratively develop sophisticated yet practical solutions that are poised to have a substantial impact in the world.

Scholars and practitioners at the Data Science Institute develop new lines of scientific inquiry, serve as a brain trust for the Greater Philadelphia Metropolitan Area, and function as a bridge for translating research and ideas into knowledge, products, and best practice for industry, government, and society at large.
